> [!TIP]
> Open your chosen scenario file alongside this guide. This page explains each SDD phase; the scenario file provides the specific prompts and checkpoints.

> [!NOTE]
> **Beginner scenarios (J, K, L)** have a dedicated design:
> - **MVP / Core / Stretch** scope tiers let facilitators control depth
> - **Decision questions** are explicitly formatted for `/speckit.clarify`
> - **Facilitator answer keys** are in [`scenarios/_answers/`](scenarios/_answers/) — keep these separate from participants until after the clarify phase

> [!NOTE]
> **Intermediate scenarios (M, N, O)** build on the beginner design and add:
> - **Server-side development** (Node.js + Express + SQLite) for the first time
> - **Shared baseline contract** — all ⭐⭐ scenarios share the same error envelope, pagination, and DB conventions (see [Intermediate Baseline Contract](#intermediate-baseline-contract) below)
> - **API-only MVP is acceptable** — UI is Core/Stretch unless the SDD lesson is specifically about UX
> - **Facilitator answer keys** are in [`scenarios/_answers/`](scenarios/_answers/)

> [!NOTE]
> **Advanced scenarios (E, F, P, Q, R)** require specifying:
> - **Failure models** — what can fail, how, and what guarantees you provide
> - **Safety invariants vs liveness goals** — things that must NEVER happen vs EVENTUALLY happen
> - **Idempotency + observability** — correlation IDs, audit logs, reconciliation stories
> - See [Advanced Baseline Contract](#advanced-baseline-contract) below
> - **Facilitator answer keys** are in [`scenarios/_answers/`](scenarios/_answers/)

---

## Intermediate Baseline Contract

All ⭐⭐ intermediate scenarios share these conventions. This reduces "meta-variance" — participants focus on the SDD concept, not boilerplate decisions.

**Standard error envelope** (all HTTP API routes in ⭐⭐ scenarios use this):
```json
{ "error": { "code": "INVALID_URL", "message": "...", "suggestion": "..." } }
```
> **Carve-outs:** Browser redirect routes may return **HTML** error pages (Scenario M: `GET /:slug`). CLI tools use CLI output contracts (Scenario H).

**Standard pagination** (cursor-based):
- Query: `?limit=20&cursor=<opaque>`
- Response: `{ "data": [...], "pagination": { "cursor": "...", "hasMore": true } }`
- Default limit: 20, max: 100. Cursor is opaque (base64-encoded); ordering is `createdAt DESC` unless stated.

**Standard date format:** ISO 8601
- Timestamps: `2026-02-10T12:34:56Z` (UTC)
- Date-only: `YYYY-MM-DD`

**Standard DB conventions:**
- `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` in every connection
- Every table has `id` (TEXT PRIMARY KEY), `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
- Transactions for multi-table writes

**Standard scripts:** `npm start` (dev server), `npm test` (supertest integration + unit)

**Standard test approach:** supertest for API contract tests, pure unit tests for business logic.

**UI policy for ⭐⭐ MVP:** API-only implementations are acceptable. UI is Core/Stretch unless the scenario's SDD lesson is specifically about UX.

---

## Advanced Baseline Contract

All ⭐⭐⭐⭐ advanced scenarios share these requirements in addition to standard conventions. Advanced scenarios require specifying **failure modes and invariants explicitly**.

**Failure model section required** — each advanced scenario must define:
- What requests/messages can be retried, duplicated, or arrive out of order
- What components can crash or become unavailable
- What clock/timing assumptions apply (drift, timeouts)

**Safety invariants vs liveness goals required:**
- **Safety invariants** = things that must NEVER happen (e.g., "never ship an unpaid order," "never assign a user to two mutually exclusive experiments")
- **Liveness goals** = things that must EVENTUALLY happen (e.g., "all clients eventually converge," "buffered events are eventually processed")

**Idempotency rule required:**
- Which endpoints/handlers are idempotent
- Which keys are used (idempotency key, event ID, evaluation ID)
- Deduplication storage strategy and TTL

**Observability requirement:**
- Correlation ID across all operations/events
- Audit log for state transitions (who/what/when)
- A "reconcile or replay" story for recovering from inconsistencies

**Standard test approach for advanced:** Contract tests + chaos/failure injection tests + invariant verification tests.

---

## Prerequisites

- A **GitHub account** (with access to GitHub Codespaces)
- Basic familiarity with **Git** and a code editor
- A general understanding of **web application** concepts

> [!NOTE]
> No local installation is required. Everything runs inside a pre-configured Dev Container on GitHub Codespaces.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This workshop is tested with **Spec Kit v0.3.0** (`specify-cli 0.3.0`). The Dev Container pins this version automatically. If you run locally, install the same version: `uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git@v0.3.0`

---

## Part 1: Setup & Context [15 min]

### 1.1 Why Spec-Driven Development?

Traditional development often follows an improvised pattern — start coding from a vague idea, fix problems as they appear, and end up with software that drifts from original intent. This is sometimes called **"vibe coding."**

**Spec-Driven Development flips this:** specifications become the primary artifact, and code becomes their expression. Instead of coding first and documenting later, you specify first and generate implementation from that specification.

| Vibe Coding | Spec-Driven Development |
|---|---|
| Start coding from a rough idea | Start with structured specifications |
| Discover edge cases during implementation | Discover edge cases during specification |
| Documentation is an afterthought | Specification IS the documentation |
| Difficult to pivot or re-implement | Pivot by updating specs and regenerating |
| Intent gets lost in code | Intent is preserved in specifications |

### 1.2 Launch Your Environment

1. Click the **"Open in GitHub Codespaces"** badge at the top of this page
2. Wait for the Dev Container to build (~2–3 minutes)
3. Once the terminal is ready, verify the setup:

```bash
specify check
specify doctor    # Diagnose project health
```

You should see confirmation that `specify`, `uv`, `git`, `python`, and `node` are installed.

### 1.3 Initialize Spec Kit

```bash
specify init . --ai copilot --force
```

This scaffolds the `.specify/` directory with templates, scripts, and configuration for GitHub Copilot as your AI agent.

> [!TIP]
> After initialization, open **GitHub Copilot Chat** in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Shift+I). You should see the `/speckit.*` slash commands available.

> [!TIP]
> If a `/speckit.*` command isn't working during the workshop, run `specify doctor` in the terminal. It diagnoses project health — missing templates, broken scripts, or configuration issues — and suggests fixes.

---

## Part 2: Establish Your Constitution [10 min]

The **constitution** defines your project's governing principles — the non-negotiable rules that guide all subsequent development. Think of it as the "architectural DNA" of your project.

**Why this matters:** Without a constitution, AI agents make their own assumptions about code quality, testing, and architecture. A constitution ensures consistency and prevents over-engineering.

👉 **Run the `/speckit.constitution` prompt from your [scenario file](#scenarios).**

> [!TIP]
> The constitution is YOUR document. If the AI generated something you disagree with, edit it directly or ask the AI to revise it. This is not a one-shot exercise.

---

## Part 3: Define Your Specification [15–20 min]

This is the most critical phase of SDD. You will describe **what** you want to build and **why**, without specifying **how**.

**Why this matters:** A well-written specification forces you to think about requirements, user stories, and edge cases before writing any code. The AI will generate structured user stories and flag ambiguities with `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers.

👉 **Run the `/speckit.specify` prompt from your [scenario file](#scenarios).**

After the command runs, examine the generated specification:

1. **Branch**: A feature branch should be created automatically
2. **Spec file**: The `spec.md` should contain user stories, functional requirements, ambiguity markers, and a review checklist

### 🤔 Discussion Point

Look at what the AI captured vs. what it flagged as unclear. These are exactly the kinds of questions that **vibe coding misses** and **SDD surfaces early**. In a traditional workflow, these ambiguities become production bugs.

---

## Part 4: Clarify the Specification [10–15 min]

Now we refine. This step is where SDD delivers its highest ROI — catching ambiguity **before** a single line of code is written.

**Why this matters:** The `/speckit.clarify` command asks structured, coverage-based questions about gaps in your specification. Every ambiguity resolved here is a bug that will never exist.

> [!NOTE]
> **Spec Kit v0.3.0:** The `/speckit.clarify` command surfaces up to **5 questions per round** (reduced from 10 in earlier versions). For scenarios with 10+ deliberate ambiguities, run `/speckit.clarify` **multiple times** to surface all gaps, or manually add missed questions. This iterative approach reinforces that specification refinement is a multi-pass process.

👉 **Run the `/speckit.clarify` prompt from your [scenario file](#scenarios).** Use the suggested answers provided, or answer with your own decisions.

After structured clarification, validate the acceptance checklist:

```
Read the review and acceptance checklist in the spec, and check off each item that the specification now satisfies. Leave unchecked any that still need work.
```

---

## Part 5: Create the Implementation Plan [15–20 min]

Now — and only now — do we talk about technology. The specification is stable; it's time to decide **how** to build it.

**Why this matters:** Separating "what" from "how" means your specification survives technology changes. Want to rebuild with a different framework? Change the plan, keep the spec.

�� **Run the `/speckit.plan` prompt from your [scenario file](#scenarios).**

After the plan is generated, ask the AI to audit itself:

```
Review the implementation plan and check: (1) Are there any over-engineered components that violate our constitution's simplicity principle? (2) Does every technical choice trace back to a requirement in the spec? (3) Is the phase ordering logical — can each phase be validated independently?
```

> [!WARNING]
> AI agents tend to over-engineer. Watch for unnecessary abstractions, excess libraries, or "future-proofing" that nobody asked for. Push back if you see it.

---

## Part 6: Generate Task Breakdown [5–10 min]

Convert the plan into an ordered, executable task list.

👉 **Run the `/speckit.tasks` prompt from your [scenario file](#scenarios).**

### What to Observe in `tasks.md`

- **Tasks grouped by user story** — each user story becomes an implementation phase
- **Dependency ordering** — data models before services, services before UI
- **`[P]` markers** — tasks that can run in parallel
- **File paths** — each task specifies exactly which files to create or modify
- **Checkpoints** — validation steps between phases

### 🤔 Discussion Point

Compare this structured task breakdown to how you would normally start coding. With SDD, every task has:
1. A clear scope (what to do)
2. A traceable origin (which user story)
3. An explicit order (what comes first)
4. Validation criteria (how to know it's done)

---

## Part 6b: Analyze (Optional) [5 min]

Before implementing, optionally run the cross-artifact consistency check:

```
/speckit.analyze
```

This validates that your spec, plan, and tasks are aligned — every spec requirement has a corresponding task, and every task traces back to a requirement. It is especially valuable for beginners learning to trust the SDD process.

> [!TIP]
> For time-constrained workshops, skip this step. For longer workshops or advanced audiences, make it a required checkpoint before implementation.

---

## Part 7: Implement [10–15 min]

Start the implementation. In a workshop setting, we will observe the process rather than wait for full completion.

In Copilot Chat, run:

```
/speckit.implement
```

The AI agent will:
1. Validate that all prerequisites exist (constitution, spec, plan, tasks)
2. Parse the task breakdown from `tasks.md`
3. Begin executing tasks in order, creating files, writing code
4. Follow the test-driven approach defined in your task plan

**What to watch for:**
- The AI follows the **task order** from `tasks.md`, not its own improvised order
- Generated code references back to **spec requirements**
- The data model matches what was defined in `data-model.md`
- No features are added that weren't in the specification

👉 **Check your [scenario file](#scenarios) for scenario-specific things to watch during implementation.**

> [!NOTE]
> Full implementation may take 10–30+ minutes depending on scenario complexity. For this workshop, observe the first few tasks being implemented, then we will discuss the results.

---

## Wrap-Up & Discussion [10 min]

### What We Accomplished

From a blank project, we produced six interconnected artifacts through the SDD lifecycle:

1. ✅ **Constitution** — governing principles for consistent development
2. ✅ **Specification** — complete, unambiguous requirements with user stories
3. ✅ **Clarifications** — edge cases and ambiguities resolved before coding
4. ✅ **Implementation Plan** — tech stack decisions with documented rationale
5. ✅ **Task Breakdown** — ordered, executable tasks with dependencies
6. ✅ **Implementation** — code generated from specifications, not from vibes

### Key Takeaways

1. **Specs catch bugs before they exist.** The clarification step surfaces edge cases that would otherwise become production bugs.
2. **AI works dramatically better with structure.** Compare the output quality of a guided `/speckit.specify` to a simple "build me an app" prompt.
3. **Pivoting becomes cheap.** Want to rebuild with a different tech stack? Change the plan, regenerate tasks, re-implement. The spec stays the same.
4. **The spec is the source of truth.** Code can be regenerated; intent cannot. Preserving intent in specifications makes software maintainable.

### Discussion Questions

- How would you adapt SDD to your current team's workflow?
- What types of projects benefit most from SDD? Where might it be overkill?
- How does SDD change the role of code review?
- What happens when the AI generates code that doesn't match the spec?

👉 **Check your [scenario file](#scenarios) for extension activities to continue after the workshop.**

---

## Cross-Artifact Analysis (All Scenarios)

After completing any scenario, run the optional consistency check:

```
/speckit.analyze
```

This validates that your spec, plan, and tasks are aligned with no gaps or contradictions.

## Facilitator Guide

### Before the Workshop

- [ ] Test the Codespace build yourself (ensure no Docker/build issues)
- [ ] Create a Codespace and run through the full flow at least once **for each scenario you plan to use**
- [ ] Prepare reference outputs for each step (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md) as fallback
- [ ] Ensure participants have GitHub accounts with Codespaces access
- [ ] Have a backup plan for network issues (screenshots of expected outputs)
- [ ] Decide which scenario(s) to offer based on audience level

| Phase | Success Indicator |
|---|---|
| After Constitution | "We can point to a principle and explain why it changes a design decision." |
| After Specify | "All deliberate ambiguities are resolved or marked as explicit non-goals." |
| After Clarify | "We answered each open question and the spec is unambiguous." |
| After Plan | "We can identify the risky parts and the chosen technical approach." |
| After Tasks | "Tasks are each 15–45 min of work with a clear 'done when' condition." |
| After Analyze | "Every spec requirement has a task; every task traces to the spec." |
| After Implement | "Generated code traces back to spec requirements; no surprise features." |

| Specification | 15 min | +5 min | Fraction system is dense; ensure participants understand allowed denominators and rounding |
| Clarification | 10 min | +5 min | Two rounds recommended; "1.5 eggs" question always gets a laugh; fraction denominators + piece rounding are key |
| Plan | 15 min | +5 min | Fraction utility must be pure functions (no DOM); scaling must be a pure function |
| Tasks | 5 min | — | Fraction utility should be the FIRST task — it's the algorithmic foundation |

| Plan | 15 min | +5 min | File hash before row processing; traceability fields (importId, sourceRowNum) in data model |
| Tasks | 5 min | — | parseCents() and date validation should be early pure-function tasks |
| Implementation | 10 min | — | Watch: string-splitting parseCents(), SHA-256 on raw bytes, SUM(amountCents) in SQL |

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| Codespace takes >5 min to build | Have participants start setup immediately; present context slides while waiting |
| `specify` command not found | Run: `uv tool install specify-cli --force --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git` |
| Project health unclear | Run `specify doctor` to diagnose project configuration issues |
| Slash commands not visible in Copilot | Re-run `specify init . --ai copilot --force`; restart Copilot Chat |
| AI generates overly complex plan | Prompt: "Simplify this plan. Remove any frameworks or libraries not explicitly requested." |
| Clarify misses some ambiguities | Spec Kit v0.3.0 asks up to 5 questions per round — run `/speckit.clarify` again to surface remaining gaps |
| Participants at different speeds | Fast finishers → Extension activities in scenario file. Slow finishers → Skip to `/speckit.tasks` with facilitator-provided plan |
| AI output differs between participants | This is expected and a teaching moment. Compare outputs to discuss how AI interprets ambiguity. |
| Scenario seems too complex for audience | Fall back to a beginner scenario (A, J, K, or L); use the harder scenario as a demo-only walkthrough |
| Beginner scenario too simple for some | Use MVP tier for beginners and Core/Stretch for fast finishers in the same scenario |

### Key Teaching Moments

1. **After Part 3 (Specify):** Ask participants to compare their generated specs. Differences highlight why specification matters — same prompt, different interpretations.
2. **After Part 4 (Clarify):** Have 2–3 participants share the most surprising question the AI asked. This demonstrates the value of structured clarification.
3. **After Part 5 (Plan):** Ask if anyone's plan includes something they didn't request. Use this to discuss AI over-engineering and the importance of constitution constraints.
4. **After Part 6 (Tasks):** Ask a participant to pick one task and trace it back through the plan to the spec. This demonstrates full traceability — the core SDD value proposition.
